# This is my favorite games! 🎮

Hi! How is it going? 😉
This project just show my favorite games. But the way it does is what matters. 
So it's an interesting project I learned some cool stuffs like:
* NextJs
* Google Spreadsheets API

I didn't know anything about thats technologies. However, I want to thank the [@omariosouto]([https://github.com/omariosouto](https://github.com/omariosouto)) to teach me that. 😂
